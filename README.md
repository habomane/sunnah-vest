# Sunnah Vest 

“Whatever you pay as interest so that it may increase (li yarbu) the wealth of people does not increase (fa la yarbu) in the sight of Allah” [ar-Rum 30:39]., i.e., it does not increase or rise in status before Allah. 

Muslims navigating the investment space within our modern world proves difficult due to the Islamic obligations for Muslims to avoid the dealings of interest. Sunnah Vest provides a platform for Muslims to purchase stocks and shares in halal businesses, free of riba. Muslims can grow their wealth without sacrificing their imaan.
